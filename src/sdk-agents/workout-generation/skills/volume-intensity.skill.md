## Week-to-Week Progression

### Linear Progression (Beginners)

- Add 2.5kg upper body / 5kg lower body weekly
- Maintain rep targets
- Reset at failure

### Double Progression (Intermediate)

- Keep weight constant
- Add reps until top of range
- Increase weight, drop to bottom of range

### RPE Progression (Advanced)

- Week 1: RPE 7
- Week 2: RPE 8
- Week 3: RPE 9
- Week 4: Deload RPE 5-6
